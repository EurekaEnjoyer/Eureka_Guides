# Basic guide to DE
Use eurekan potions when using DE always, ideally you use it at 37-40 seconds left on the DE timer so the potion covers all of the end stacks. use melee bloodbath action with 20 seconds left on DE (this will actually do a ton of self healing), use second wind if you get low or right after a raidwide.
If you're a tank use self-healing also, raw intuition, equil, aurora, TBN, etc. try and burst at the end of the DE, if you're a warrior you want to hold and use Inner Release for the very end of Double Edge. On Samurai you want to burn as much gauge at the end of the DE, GNB/PLD/MNK etc. hold their dmg buff for the end of it.   
# Bosses
### Art/Owain 
Use DE when you engage the boss. 
### Raiden
Use DE 5 seconds before pull so it finishes right as ame starts   
### AV
Use DE when you engage the boss, can also do 20 seconds before the boss.  
### Ozma
Use DE 25 seconds (8 eorzean) before the boss for alignment against the first shade movements, or use on pull   
# Chain DEing
DE will stay at the current stacks with a fresh 48 seconds timer if you apply a new double edge while its already running, this is how people do mega dmg. Need an a willing healer to do this though, you'll take 5.5k dmg every 3 seconds. if you want to start a boss with 16 stacks of DE you'll start 45-50 seconds before the boss (15-17 eorzean minutes).
