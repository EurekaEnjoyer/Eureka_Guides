## Introduction

As a callback to FFXI, Eureka's mobs, in the overworld and in Baldesion Arsenal (BA), have different kinds of aggro.  Mobs around and above your Elemental Level (EL) will aggro you.  The ROG/NIN Ability Hide as well as Stealth L can be used to evade mobs up to 10 elemental levels above yours, but there are exceptions which we will point out.  Below are the types of aggro and some examples:

## Touch Aggro

Running directly through a mob can cause it to aggro you. This is trvivial because just about every mob has this kind of aggro.

## Sight Aggro

This is the most common non-trivial form of aggro.  You will draw aggro if you walk within its "field of vision": an invisible cone extending out from the front of the mob. This however does not extend out infinitely; it terminates at a distance so if you are far away you will not aggro it.

## Sound Aggro

You will draw aggro if you *run* anywhere near this mob, even if you're behind it.  Mobs with this kind of aggro can be easily evaded by toggling movement speed to walk (by default `NUMPAD /`).

### Examples: 
EL21 Magia Fan (Anemos), EL40 Ameretat (Pagos), EL49 Pyros Hawk, EL65 Arsenal Tome (BA).

## Sleeping Dragons Aggro

The sleeping dragons you may encounter in Pagos and Pyros can be safely evaded by walking around them, but Hide/Stealth L will not work in evading these.

## Magic Aggro

This is most commonly associated with **sprites**, as it is their main form of aggro.  Casting spells (using logos actions count!) near this mob will draw aggro.

### Examples: 
All sprites, EL48 Pure White Flame (Eureka Pyros), EL66 Arsenal Sprite (BA).

## Blood Aggro

This is most commonly associated with **ashkin** (undead / night-only mobs), as it is their main form of aggro.  If your HP is low (<50%), you may aggro it.

### Examples: 
EL34 Haunt (Pagos), EL54 Soulless Pathfinder (Pyros), EL65 Samurai Corpse (Hydatos), EL66 Arsenal Logos (BA).

## True Sight Aggro

This is an uncommon form of aggro usually associated with birds and mobs with lots of eyes.  It is similar to sight aggro, but Hide/Stealth L will not work.

### Examples: 
EL39 Gawper (Pagos), EL40 Val Griffin (Pagos), EL53 Val Skatene (Pyros), EL54 Pyros Hecteyes, EL54 Ancient Voidragon (Pyros).

## True Sound (Proximity) Aggro

This is a rare form of aggro similar to sound aggro, but walking and Hide/Stealth L will not work.  It will aggro you without fail if you are closeby.  The examples below are the only known mobs with this type of aggro.

### Examples: 
EL57 Lake Yabby (Hydatos), EL57 Eo'ghrah (Hydatos).

## BA Mob Linking

The Baldesion Arsenal hallway mobs are similar to dungeon trash or overworld mobs in that pulling one mob can result in others being drawn.  If you pull a mob of a particular element, mobs of that same element in its immediate surroundings may also be pulled.  You can sometimes see yellow lines between mobs indicating this linkage.
