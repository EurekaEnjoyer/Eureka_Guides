### Accessories
  Synced > [Imperial Jade](https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/item/?patch=&db_search_category=item&category2=4&difficulty=white&q=Imperial+Jade) > [Cassie Earring](https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/item/88febc019e0/), [Blitzring](https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/item/72964542ed0/)(†)

## Additional Information

### iLvl-Sync and Materia Melding

  Due to the iLvl-sync of 300 inside each Eureka zone, materia melds on gear *above* iLvl 300 provide no additional stats.  Synced accessories begins at iLvl 430 (or iLlvl 480 for NQ-crafted) because all substats cap that those points.

### Eureka Effect: Elemental Bonus

  Physeos, Cloak/Osode, Elemental +2 ("+2") are the most important parts of Best-in-Slot since they provide Elemental Bonus, which makes them considerably stronger than any other pieces of gear inside Eureka.

### Eureka Effect: Haste

  Certain pieces of gear obtainable from Eureka feature a "Haste +3" bonus, which directly lowers (does not increase Skill, Spell Speed substats) both melee and magic GCDs.  Each point of Haste reduces GCD and other cast and recast times by about 1% per point of haste.  

### Cloak, Osode (iLvl 300)

  Cloak and Osode are almost always better than +2 top (and headgear combined, if Cloak). They both provide Haste +3; provide better substats for most jobs; provide 5 guaranteed meld slots, each of which can be filled with grade-6 (+16) materia; and can be obtained by going to the [Nostalgic Fellow](https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/shop/7d89aa95bfc/?type=currency) at Pier #1  and exchanging 2 [Cryptic Seals](https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/item/a189bc584c0/) for an Osode or 3 [Damascene Cloth](https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/item/9844ee0ceb7/) for a Cloak, both of which can be bought off Market Board or obtained from coffers inside The Baldesion Arsenal.

### Pagos Haste Gear (Optical Hat, Cassie Earring, and Blitzring)
    
  These pieces of gear feature only main stats and Haste +3, no substats.  Replacing synced gear for these usually results in a damage loss. Optical Hat does not provide enough main stats to cap values for headgear slot, so it will almost always be worse compared to synced.  Cassie Earring has an unusually low Vitality value which will not cap, so you will have slightly less HP compared to synced.

### Imperial Jade (iLvl 290) Accessories

  It is not uncommon to see players using HQ, pentamelded, Imperial Jade accessories inside Eureka.  Replacing synced accessories with these, which effectively trades main stats for more substats, resulting usually in a damage loss and always in a HP loss.  There may be specific cases where using jade is a damage gain, but any gain will be miniscule.
