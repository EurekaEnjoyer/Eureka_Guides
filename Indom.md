 **NOTE:** There are many ways to build Indom, almost any high level mob can be used in some capacity, experiment and find out what you like 
  **IMPORTANT:** Mitigation and Eurekan Potions are extremely important. Not using your personal mitigation will result in your death. Faerie Buff also helps, but it is not required. Hyper-Potions also 
  # Building Wisdom of the Indomitable Outside BA
  ## Zebus
   Gear Setup: Physeos Equipped. All Rightside Gear Equipped. 
   1. Left Side removed (Helmet, Chest, Gloves, Legs, Boots)
   2. Click Echo off. 
   3. SOTR on. 
   4. Protect if possible 
   5. Be spun 5 Defensive (Earth) Use Eurekan Potion before pull 
   6. Use 20% mit on pull (Rampart), use Raw Intuition as the mob reaches you 
   7. Get 3 stacks while in 5 Defensive. Stand in AOEs they are good for building stacks. At 3 stacks switch to 0 Defensive Magia, Press 30% Mit (Vengeance). Continue building stacks.Use other personal mit as your HP Drops. 
   8. At any time if you feel like your HP is getting low you can use Low Blow to stun the Zebu, sprint away, and leash the mob. Resume building stacks afterwards You can get 12 or so stacks this way (or more from just the AOEs). Remove rightside gear if you want to build final stacks, or just get them inside BA from refreshes

## Claws
The same as Zebus, but they hit slightly harder. Easier to get final stacks, but much more lethal 
## Ovni
Not recommended, reduces the amount of threat you do on Ovni (and therefore jeopardizes your party's gold rating), but very easy to safely build 7-8 stacks. Simply Click off echo and stand in Ovni's AOEs. Heavily mitigate Ion Storm, as it does a ton of damage even with Indom on. Build remaining stacks on Zebu or Claws.
     
## Notes 
- Cure L is not required to build indom at all, but it can be used to heal yourself and make building a lot safer at the cost of a mostly worthless plate. Use Mitigation and Self Healing (edited)

# Building Wisdom of the Indomitable Inside BA
Basically any mob can be used for this, but the most convenient is the Skatene Be very careful when pulling skatenes as they link together. If you pull multiple skatenes, press all of your mitigation, take a hit or two, stun one and sprint away to leash. 
## Building from 0 Stacks 
Gear Setup: Physeos Equipped. Right Side Gear Equipped. Left Side gear removed (Helmet, Chest, Gloves, Legs, Boots) 
1. Use Eurekan Potion before pull Use 30% mit on pull (Vengeance) Use Raw Intuition as you engage the mob, get full value from its healing 
2. Use 20% mit when 30% wears (Rampart) Use other personal mit as your HP drops This will allow you to get 7-8 stacks safely starting from 0 stacks. 
3. You will not be able to build all the way, and will need to leash the Skatene and take off the rest of your gear (Keep Physeos equipped) to fully build. 
4. Stun the mob with Low Blow, and sprint away when you want to leash, or if you think you are getting low and might die. 
 ## Refreshing Indom Stacks (or Building from 7+ stacks)
 1.  Gear Setup: Physeos Equipped. All other gear removed 
 2. Use Eurekan Potion before pull Use 30% mit on pull (Vengeance) Use 20% mit when 30% wears (Rampart) 
 3. Stun mob with Low Blow, and sprint away when you have refreshed 
 4. Use Mitigation and Self Healing
