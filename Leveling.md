## DEFINITIVE/OPTIMAL EUREKA SOLO LEVELING GUIDE

**This is the fastest way to level. There are other ways but they are more likely to lead to frustration and burnout. Following this guide you should be able to reach level 60 in about one lockout of each zone.** **Important tips:**

- Start on a monday so u have challenge log for anemos and then pagos on tuesday after reset
- Grab a kirin's osode/vermilion cloak for your job of choice (the tradein pieces 2 cryptic seals for kirin 3 damascene for vermillion can be bought off marketboard and traded to Nostalgic Fellow on Pier 1)
- Always have a harmony pot active while in zone (can be bought off marketboard)
- Get eurekan potions for sustain (can be bought at base camp provisioner)
- [Use the bestiary](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Z3sDux_-UTf9LQ0DYuKvemXKP4DLK4K34Rtn72mAmpY/htmlview#gid=1696169989) Mutates/adapts are important in zones past anemos
- [Use the maps to locate mobs](https://ffxiv-eureka.com/ )
- [Use logograms once you have them unlocked](https://ffxiv-eureka.com/logograms)
- You do **not** need Notorious Monsters (NMs/FATEs) to level and you get no crystals from NMs that are more than one level above you. The higher they are than you the worse the xp from them gets. Leveling strictly through nms is the slowest way to level.
